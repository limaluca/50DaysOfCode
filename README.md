# 50DaysOfCode
In this repo, i'll display my progress while I study an Udemy course called '50 Projects in 50 Days'.

I expect to sharp my skills and have fun by building those 50 quick, unique & fun mini projects :)

I am also deploying these projects on vercel for anyone to check them out and my next challenge is building a portfolio page to organize them!
